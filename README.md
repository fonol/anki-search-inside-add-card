# anki-search-inside-add-card
See the add-on page for a description. All contributors welcome.  

The add-on's development always targets the newest Anki version, which means clones/forks of the current state here on Github might not work on older Anki versions.  

To build, run `npm run build` in the `/web` subfolder.
